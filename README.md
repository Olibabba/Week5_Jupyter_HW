# Week5_Jupyter_HW


## Overview

In a continued analysis of uber data, I was asked to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type: rural, urban, and suburban. I was then to graph the total weekly fares by city type.

## Analysis

There are stark differences between the the volume of riders and drivers, and thus, the fares paid and earned in different city types. The differences are largely to be expected, more in the urban areas where there are more people, and less in the rural areas.

This difference can be seen clearly in the graph below.

How big are these differences exactly? 

As we see in the chart below, urban areas had:
- 1,000 more rides than suburban areas
- 1,500 more rides than rural areas

- 1,915 more drivers than suburban areas
- 2,327 more drivers than rural areas

- $20,498.05 more total fare earned than suburban areas
- $35,526.45 more total fare earned than rural areas

On the whole, urban areas completely eclipse the suburban and rural areas. However this added density in urban areas also drives down the fares for riders and drivers.

In urban areas:
- The average fare per ride is $6.44 less than suburban areas
- The average fare per ride is $10.09 less than rural areas

- The average fare per driver is $22.93 less than suburban areas
- The average fare per driver is $38.92 less than rural areas
