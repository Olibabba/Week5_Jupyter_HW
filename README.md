# Week5_Jupyter_HW


## Overview

In a continued analysis of uber data, I was asked to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type: rural, urban, and suburban. I was then to graph the total weekly fares by city type.

## Analysis

There are stark differences between the the volume of riders and drivers, and thus, the fares paid and earned in different city types. The differences are largely to be expected, more in the urban areas where there are more people, and less in the rural areas.

This difference can be seen clearly in the graph below:

How big are these differences exactly? 

As we see in the chart below, urban areas had:
- 1,000 more rides than suburban areas
- 1,915 more drivers than suburban areas
- $20,498.05 more total fare earned than suburban areas

- 1,500 more rides than rural areas
- 2,327 more drivers than rural areas
- $35,526.45 more total fare earned than rural areas

On the whole, urban areas completely eclipse the suburban and rural areas. However this added density in urban areas also drives down the fares for riders and drivers.

In urban areas:
- The average fare per ride is $6.44 less than suburban areas
- The average fare per driver is $22.93 less than suburban areas

- The average fare per ride is $10.09 less than rural areas
- The average fare per driver is $38.92 less than rural areas

## Summary

So urban areas see more volume and less fare overall, and the opposite being the case for rural and suburban areas. While the volume, total fares, and lower fares for riders in urban areas is no doubt a good thing, it is not ideal for drivers to have to make over twice the rides to make the same fare as a rural driver. In the same vein rural drivers likely do not mind making more money with less trips.

With the differences highlighted above in mind, I bring three recommendations

First, to address the shortfalls in urban and suburban areas, I recommend increasing advertising and/or market research to increase the number and marketshare of rides in rural and suburban areas.

To address the low fares for drivers in urban areas I see two options:
- Put a limit on the number of drivers. This could have unanticipated consequenses however, and should be considered with caution
- Raising the base fares charged would not only increase the take-home pay for drivers, but would also increase PyBers revanue as well. The increase paid per ride should perhaps be considered against the competitition from other ride share services in each city.
